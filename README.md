### Project Overview

 
#### IPL Dataset Analysis

#### Problem Statement
Cricket is a game played prominently in the Indian subcontinent, Australia, United Kingdom and Southern Africa. If you are unfamiliar with the game of cricket, refer to this good introduction to the game ->

We want to know as to what happens during an IPL match which raises several questions in our mind with our limited knowledge about the game called cricket on which it is based. This analysis is done to know as which factors led one of the team to win and how does it matter.

####About the Dataset :
The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional T20 cricket league in India contested during April-May of every year by teams representing Indian cities. It is the most-attended cricket league in the world and ranks sixth among all the sports leagues. It has teams with players from around the world and is very competitive and entertaining with a lot of close matches between teams.

The IPL and other cricket related datasets are available at cricsheet.org. Feel free to visit the website and explore the data by yourself as exploring new sources of data is one of the interesting activities a data scientist gets to do.


### Learnings from the project

 -  Python 

-  Data Wrangling

- Data Structure of Python, specifically, list, dictionary and list of dictionary 

- Data Analysis


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 - First step was to load the data and understand the structure of data 

- Second, was to move one step at a time to answer the questions 


### Challenges faced

 Understanding dictionary structure, fetching keys and values and applying them based on the requirement was challenging.
